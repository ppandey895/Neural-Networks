Among various logical gates, the XOR or also known as the “exclusive or” problem is one of the logical operations when performed on binary inputs that yield output for different combinations of input, and for the same combination of input no output is produced. The outputs generated by the XOR logic are not linearly separable in the hyperplane. So  In this article let us see what is the XOR logic and how to integrate the XOR logic using neural networks.
